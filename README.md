You can see the deployed project [here](https://zurc.github.io/huddle-landing-page/)

## Styled Components - my views

It's a nice way to style a React app project. 
Based on tagged template literals you can use normal CSS properties instead of JS.
You can create components and pass props using unique class names.
You can easily create a theme; conditionally add/remove styles (dynamic styling); extend styles.
It offers the possibility to still use classNames when needed
It handles automatic vendor prefixing.
